WWW-phpBB version 0.02
======================

DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to scrape a phpBB instalation using the web
interface. It requires a local phpBB setup that will be overwritten and it can
only access what is available to the web browser (no private messages or user
settings). Scraping is possible as a guest or as a loged in member. If used
with an administrator name and password it will copy all the members' e-mails
(not just the public ones) allowing them to request a new random password from
the new installation site and continue using the forum. The current implementation
lacks search support, but this problem will disappear if you convert the forum
to SMF. The "mforum" script is supported.
